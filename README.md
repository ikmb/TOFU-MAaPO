Overview of TOFU-MAaPO 1.3.1

# Overview

The pipeline analyses metagenomic short reads and can perform analysis for taxonomic profiling, abundance of microbial metabolic pathways and assembly of metagenomic genomes. 


TOFU-MAaPO is a Nextflow pipeline for the processing and analysis of metagenomic short reads with a focus on gut metagenomes. The pipeline can run on any linux system and needs as dependencies only Nextflow and the container engine Singularity. An installation step is not needed as Nextflow can automatically download all needed files. <br />

The pipeline can install needed databases on its own, see for this the usage documentation. The pipeline can therefor be downloaded and executed in one single command line call. It requires short single- or paired-end metagenomic shotgun sequencing FASTQ files as input, or a single csv file containing a list of samples and their associated FASTQ files or can download data from SRA by giving the project or sample id as an input.<br />

TOFU-MAaPO processes the data for quality control and possible host decontamination (optional) and performs downstream analysis for taxonomic abundance profiles of each sample using Kraken2, Bracken, Salmon and/or Metaphlan4, metabolic pathway analysis using HUMAnN (v3.6) and assembly of metagenomic genomes (MAGs).<br />

Genome assembly is done by generating contigs from the qc'ed reads with Megahit (single samples, grouped or all samples combined). The contigs are then catalogued and indexed using minimap2 and then binned with the option to use up to five binning tools (Metabat2, Concoct, Maxbin, Semibin2 and vamb). The resulting bins will then be refined and, where possible, combined with MAGScoT based on sets of single-copy microbial marker genes from the Genome Taxonomy Database. The profiles of present marker genes in each result from the different binning algorithms are compared, and new hybrid candidate bins are created if the bin sets share a user-adjustable proportion of marker genes. The results are also taxonomically annotated with GTDB-TK and quality checked with checkm. An estimated bin coverage per sample is generated as additional output. 

# Quick start

Install and make sure, Singularity (now Apptainer) and Nextflow are working. For example via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):
```bash
# Create a new conda environment for Singularity and Nextflow
conda create --name nf_env -c conda-forge -c bioconda singularity nextflow
# Activate environment
conda activate nf_env
# Try a simple Nextflow demo
nextflow run hello
# Check Singularity
singularity --version
```

The inputs to TOFU-MAaPO are fastq.gz files or SRA IDs (sample or project).

Running a workflow for human gut metagenomes with qc and assembly for local files would be called like this:
```
nextflow run ikmb/TOFU-MAaPO \
    -profile custom \
    --reads '/path/to/fastqfiles/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz' \
    --assembly \
    --updategtdbtk \
    --gtdbtk_reference '/path/to/download/gtdbtk_db/to' \
    --outdir results
```
For detailed installation guide see the [installation and configuration documentation](docs/installation.md).
